# ðŸ“” Vapor Todo Backend

Run the specs [here](https://vapor-todo.herokuapp.com/)

[Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) is a Swift backend framework to build server-side applications in Swift.

[TodoBackend](http://www.todobackend.com) is a proof-of-concept catalog to demonstrate the implementation of the same simple API using different backend frameworks.

This project is a TodoBackend implementation using Vapor, Swift and MySQL as a backend stack.

## ðŸŒŽ Environment

- Swift 3.0 Gold Master
- MySQL Database Credentials

## ðŸ¦„ Deploy

Fully deploy w/ MySQL Database included on Heroku.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## ðŸ›  Setup

### Swift 3.0

Download latest Xcode 8 and make sure it's been opened at least once. Also make sure command line tools are set to Xcode 8 in Xcode's preferences.

> Xcode > Preferences > Locations > Command Line Tools

### MySQL Config

To build, the first place you'll want to look is the `Config/` directory. In their, you should create a `secrets` folder and a nested `mysql.json`. Here's how my `Config/` folder looks locally.

```
Config/
  - mysql.json
	secrets/
	  - mysql.json
```

The `secrets` folder is under the gitignore and shouldn't be committed.

Here's an example `secrets/mysql.json`

```json
{
  "host": "z99a0.asdf8c8cx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
  "user": "username",
  "password": "badpassword",
  "database": "databasename",
  "port": "3306",
  "encoding": "utf8"
}

```

### Vapor CLI

The Vapor Command Line Interface makes it easy to build and run Vapor projects. Install it on Mac by running

#### Brew

```sh
brew install vapor/tap/toolbox
```

#### Curl

```sh
curl -sL toolbox.vapor.sh | bash
```

## Manual Deploy

When deploying, one may optionally include the `secrets` folder if they have a secure way of doing so. The official deploy is done through use of environment variables configured on the server that match the following scheme.

#### `mysql.json`

```
{
  "host": "$MYSQL_HOST",
  "user": "$MYSQL_USER",
  "password": "$MYSQL_PASS",
  "database": "$MYSQL_DB",
  "port": "$MYSQL_PORT",
  "encoding": "utf8"
}

// OR

{
  "url": "mysql://user:pass@host:3306/database"
}
```
